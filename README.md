Raspberry Pi involves several components, including hardware like ultrasonic sensors, cameras, and software to control the system. I'll provide you with a simplified Python code for a basic smart parking system using a Raspberry Pi and an ultrasonic sensor. This code can be a starting point for your project. Please note that this is a simple example, and a full-fledged smart parking system would be more complex.
